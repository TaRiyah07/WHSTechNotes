As a class i feel like we treated the sub well and made the sub feel as if there job was easy. I think to make subs still want to do their job, kids should not be acting out just because our teacher isnt there but they feel as if they can do whatever they want ecause the sub "doesnt know the rules". To keep students undercontrol i feel like one responsible person from the class should take up for the class when they start to act out or get loud , and not listening to the sub.
